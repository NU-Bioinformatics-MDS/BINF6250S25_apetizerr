# Project 7 Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)
## Description 

The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is an algorithm for data compression allowing low computational storage and easy access. The algorithm first sorts rotational possibility of the characters then organized them lexicographically and then grabs the last column. Now in bioinformatics it is an efficient method to query matching alignments to the reference genome.
