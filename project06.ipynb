    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will implement a distance-based phylogenetic tree construction method using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) algorithm and Smith-Waterman local alignment scores. Unlike UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method using Arithmetic averages), NJ produces unrooted trees and does not assume a constant evolutionary rate across lineages, making it more biologically realistic for analyzing sequence relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use HIV-1 reverse transcriptase sequences to construct our phylogenetic tree. The Smith-Waterman algorithm will be used to generate pairwise local alignment scores, which will then be converted into distances for tree construction. This approach is particularly suitable for HIV sequence analysis as it:\n",
    "1. Handles sequence variations effectively through local alignment\n",
    "2. Accounts for potential rate heterogeneity across different viral strains\n",
    "3. Does not assume a molecular clock\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate output will be an unrooted phylogenetic tree representing the evolutionary relationships between the HIV-1 sequences, visualized using the ete3 library. This method provides insights into viral diversity and evolutionary patterns while avoiding the assumptions of simpler hierarchical clustering approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key innovations of this implementation are:\n",
    "- Use of Smith-Waterman for sensitive local alignment scoring\n",
    "- Implementation of Neighbor-Joining for unrooted tree construction\n",
    "- More biologically realistic evolutionary model"
